== DESCRIPTION:

Runs (Get it? It's fast!) your tests and makes it easier to rerun individual
failures.

=== Tab Completion

Add this to your .bashrc (or .zshrc?--someone please confirm with a PR):

  $ complete -o bashdefault -f -C 'ruby --disable-gems $(gem which minitest/complete)' minitest

Running individual minitest tests will now have tab completion for the
method names. When running tests, just hit tab after -n. For example:

  $ minitest test/test_whatever.rb -n test_thingy<TAB><TAB>
  test_thingy_error
  test_thingy_error_teardown
  test_thingy_failing
  test_thingy_failing_filtered
  ... etc ...

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* TEENY implementation.
* Includes a script for commandline autocompletion of test names.
* Includes extra plugins to print out failure re-run commands.
  * One for the minitest commandline runner. (--binstub)
  * One for rake test runners. (--rake)
* Uses path_expander, so you can use:
  * dir_arg -- expand a directory automatically
  * @file_of_args -- persist arguments in a file
  * -path_to_subtract -- ignore intersecting subsets of files/directories

== SYNOPSIS:

  $ minitest test/test_whatever.rb -n test_thingy<TAB><TAB>
  test_thingy_error
  test_thingy_error_teardown
  test_thingy_failing
  test_thingy_failing_filtered
  ... etc ...

  # Rakefile
  Minitest::TestTask.create do |t|
    t.extra_args = ["--rake"] # Or --binstub
  end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ruby

== INSTALL:

* gem install minitest-sprint
